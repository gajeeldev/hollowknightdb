'Broken Vessel is found in a room of the Ancient Basin that is overgrown with Infection bulbs. When approached, parasitic Lightseeds rush to fill its broken shell, forming a large protruding bulb.

The Troupe Master is aware that the Knight called them with the Lantern and offers them the choice to participate in their Ritual.[5] He then gives them the Grimmchild and entrusts them to collect the Nightmare Flames gathered by his Grimmkins throughout Hallownest.

With each set of three Flames gathered, Grimm has the Grimmchild consume them to grow. After the second set, the Troupe Master tests the Knight s strength in a fiery, theatrical battle, in preparation for their confrontation with the Nightmare King. He also rewards them with a Charm Notch.

After collecting the third set of Flames, Grimm can be found sleeping in his quarters. As such, he is ready for the Knight to use the Dream Nail on him and enter the Nightmare Realm. If they successfully slay the Nightmare King, the Ritual is completed, and the Troupe leaves Hallownest before the Knight wakes up. The Troupe also disappears if the Knight helps Brumm banish them instead of facing the King.
Grimm can be summoned to Godhome by the Godseeker s own ritual. There he is conscious of his surroundings and delighted to participate, even though he is not a native of Hallownest. He takes part in both the Pantheon of the Sage and the Pantheon of Hallownest. In the latter, the Nightmare King appears as one of the last three Gods at its peak. Even though away from the Nightmare Realm, the Heart still watches over the Nightmare King s fight.

'The Hollow Knight is the Vessel chosen by the Pale King to seal away the Radiance and save Hallownest from the Infection. Like their siblings, they are the child of the King and Queen of Hallownest, birthed in the Abyss to be infused with the power of the Void. As such, they are genderless. This birth condition was also supposed to leave them without a mind, will, and voice, to prevent the Radiance from influencing them. However, their purity was misjudged, tarnished by an idea instilled, possibly a bond with the Pale King who raised them and whom the Hollow Knight was very close to.

Regardless of their impurity, the Hollow Knight was trained and raised, eventually becoming a fully grown Vessel. The Radiance was sealed within them, and they were chained within the Temple of the Black Egg where they were expected to contain the Infection for eternity. However, because of the aforementioned impurities, the Radiance could still exert influence. It ultimately resulted in the resurgence of the Infection and the Kingdom falling into ruin.

Over time, the Hollow Knight disappeared from the fallen Kingdom s memory. Only the Memorial in the middle of the City of Tears testifies of their sacrifice to save Hallownest.

After some time, the Radiance s power broke out of the Hollow Knight, cracking their shell and fully Infecting them. This event was the catalyst that brought the Knight back to Hallownest. The Knight can free and fight the Hollow Knight after killing the three Dreamers who sealed the Black Egg s entrance.
',
'The fate of the Hollow Knight is linked to the end of the Knight s journey. By killing the Hollow Knight, the Knight takes their place in sealing the Radiance. By instead using the Awoken Dream Nail on them with the help of Hornet, the Knight can defeat the Radiance. At the end of this fight, the Hollow Knight s Shade appears and opens up a weak point on her head, allowing the Knight to land the finishing blows. The two siblings then return to the Void together.

The Hollow Knight is also inherently part of the Godseeker s ritual. She seeks to attune the Radiance to Godhome through the Hollow Knight. In doing so, she summons the Pure Vessel instead, their uninfected form. Once the Knight defeats the Pure Vessel in the Pantheon of the Knight, the Radiance reaches Godhome.

After the Knight defeats Absolute Radiance at the peak of the Pantheon of Hallownest, the Infection vanishes from Hallownest. The Hollow Knight can then be seen walking out of the Black Egg, freed from the Infection. They are met outside by a startled Hornet.
