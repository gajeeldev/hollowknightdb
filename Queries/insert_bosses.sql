'Broken Vessel is found in a room of the Ancient Basin that is overgrown with Infection bulbs. When approached, parasitic Lightseeds rush to fill its broken shell, forming a large protruding bulb. These Lightseeds can be killed, but this has no effect. The Infection reanimates the husk and causes it to attack the Knight. Like other Vessels, it has no voice, but the Infection within screams like the Radiance. Upon defeat, the Infection is cleared from Broken Vessel s husk, and it reaches out to the Knight before finally collapsing.

Using the Dream Nail on the husk after leaving and re-entering the room brings the Knight to a dream. There, Lost Kin, a stronger form of Broken Vessel, still controlled by Lightseeds, can be fought. After its defeat, the spirit of Broken Vessel floats above its husk. Appearing unmarred by the Infection, it offers the Knight a silent bow before shattering into 400 Essence to be collected by the Dream Nail.',

It appears larger than the other husks, has crystal growing on its back and encasing both its arms and its head. It also has more mastery over the crystal s light than the Crystallised Husks.

While encased in crystal, the Guardian shrieks similarly to the Radiance although at a higher pitch. When cleared of the crystal, it has a normal bug voice. Like the other miner husks, it is obsessed with the light but has grown too tired to mine it relentlessly as they do.',

Still animated by the Infection, it stands up and escapes by jumping through the ceiling.

The Guardian can be followed to the room above its abandoned resting place using the Monarch Wings. There, it has regained its crystal growths, but its first defeat has made it mad with anger, triggering its second form, the Enraged Guardian.

He was also equally renowned for his bad scent, although that did not keep him from enjoying the company of the White Lady and his fellow knights. He was particularly fond of the knight Isma.

Ogrim survived the Infection but isolated himself in a part of the Royal Waterways where refuse gathers. There, as the Dung Defender, he guards the pump control that allows entry to Isma s Grove on the other side of the sewers. The Dung Defender defies any who would enter the place to challenge him. He also passes time by rolling dung around and moulding statues out of it.

The Dung Defender seems unaware of the fate of his king and the other knights. In his isolation, he deludes himself into thinking they will return and that Hallownest can be reborn.',
'The Dung Defender can first be heard at the entrance of his dirty domain. He mistakes the Knight for a mindless husk and attacks them. Once defeated, he leaves behind his Defender s Crest Charm before burying underground in the background.

When returning to his area after sitting on a Bench, the Dung Defender pops his head out of the ground to greet the Knight. He apologizes for attacking them and remarks on how they have proven their honour in battle. He notices when the Knight has acquired Isma s Tear and explains that he is unable to visit his fellow knight s grove due to his oath and duties.

Using the Desolate Dive/Descending Dark Spell on the ground below the pump s lever reveals a hidden cave where the Dung Defender rests. There, he moulded dung statues of the Five Great Knights, and one of the Pale King on the other side with a King s Idol on it.',
