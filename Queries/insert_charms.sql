'Prevents the Knight from taking damage if hit with an attack while using Focus. The Knight also gains invincibility frames as if they were hit normally despite not taking damage.

The shell can only absorb up to four hits before it breaks and it can only be repaired by resting at a Bench. The durability is represented by a tiny image of a blue shell that appears below the SOUL meter. As it takes hits, cracks form in the shell, until it breaks completely.

This Charm is of debatable use, as taking a hit while Focusing still interrupts the charge and wastes SOUL, rendering the protection pointless. On top of that, it can only block four hits of damage and only regenerates when resting at a Bench. Due to this, Baldur Shell is outclassed by Quick Focus and even Shape of Unn for mid-battle healing.

Its best use is against bosses that have a certain attack that is difficult to avoid. Starting to Focus during that attack can save the trouble of having to dodge it and risk losing health. Even so, its limited hits mean that it loses its effect in drawn-out battles.

Note that Baldur Shell cannot be activated if the Knight does not have enough SOUL, as in order to use Focus there has to be a minimum of 33 SOUL in the gauge.',

Dashmaster also does not decrease the charge time of the Super Dash or the Shade Cloak. At that point, it is most useful when combined with Sharp Shadow.

'The regenerating Mask is marked by a small blob of dripping honey that slowly grows bigger. Taking damage again while regenerating starts the process over (at the Knight s current health). In the case of an attack that deals two Masks of damage (such as an explosion), Hiveblood only regenerates one Mask. Finally, healing a Mask with Focus ends the regeneration in progress.

Hiveblood does regenerate Lifeblood Masks gained from the Joni s Blessing Charm, though it takes twice as long (20s). Other sources of Lifeblood — like Lifeblood Cocoons, or the Lifeblood Heart and Lifeblood Core Charms — are not affected.

Hiveblood is decent in combat if the Knight can dodge a boss effectively, but has trouble finding opportunities to heal. As the Knight is likely to not go on the offensive while waiting for Hiveblood to regenerate health, Hiveblood pairs well with Charms that can damage foes while dodging, such as Glowing Womb or Sharp Shadow.

The best use of Hiveblood is to regenerate health in situations where SOUL is not readily available. This makes it very helpful in difficult platforming sections with few enemies, such as the Crystallised Mound in the Crystal Peak, the path to Nailmaster Sheo in Greenpath, the Nail-jumping section to reach a Vessel Fragment in Deepnest, and most prominently, the White Palace and the Path of Pain.

It also serves as the only means by which health may be recovered mid-air, making it useful for the Colosseum of Fools.

Its ability to render the Hive s residents passive makes it very useful on return trips to the area.',

However, Lifeblood Core is usually a more efficient Charm for adding survivability in the endgame. Joni s Blessing adds at most 5 Lifeblood Masks while Lifeblood Core adds 4, costs 1 less Notch, and does not prevent healing.',
